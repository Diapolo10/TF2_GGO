Contributing to the TF2 GGO project
===================================

Filing a bug report
-------------------

To file a bug report, open the [Issues](https://github.com/Diapolo10/TF2_GGO/issues) tab and add a new issue, labeling it as a bug report.
If you wish to try and fix it yourself, add yourself as a contributor to that issue. You are allowed to group similiar bugs into one issue report, as long as you don't exceed the limit of three different bugs. Otherwise, make another issue.

Suggesting a new feature
------------------------

To suggest a new feature:
 * For small suggestions, you can directly go to the [Projects](https://github.com/Diapolo10/TF2_GGO/projects) tab and write a suggestion to the Suggestions/Ideas column
 * For medium-to-large suggestions, write an issue, mark it as part of the current project and label it as a suggestion
 
You may NOT suggest features through email to the core developers.
 
Setting up your development environment
---------------------------------------
 
You won't need anything special:
  1. A working Git or GitHub installation (optional, but helps)
  2. A text/code editor (Visual Studio Code is good)
  3. Team Fortress 2 installed (for the HUD files, and testing)
  4. GCFScape (for extracting said HUD files)
