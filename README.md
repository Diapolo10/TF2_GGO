TF2 GGO HUD mod
===============

This is a HUD mod for Team Fortress 2 that aims to provide a "genuine" Gun Gale Online experience. Anyone can contribute!

Getting started
---------------

Download a copy of the source code. This can be done from the main GitHub-page (select 'Download ZIP' from the right-side of the page), or you can use Git to download it from the command line, using:

    git clone https://github.com/diapolo10/TF2_GGO.git

Project goals
-------------

This is what the author's vision on what the project could look like when nearing completion:

![\[Insert Mockup image for the HUD here\]](./mockup.png)

Mock-up explanation:

 * As health drops below 25%, the bar will turn red
 * Overheal causes the bar to turn green, for as long as the player's health is higher than their maximum health
 * Instead of 3D models, all classes are identified using class symbols
 * (At least in MVM) the team's health (max. 6 other players?) can be seen on the left of the screen
 * The bottom-right corner of the screen has the player's health, ammo and worn weapons

Things not yet displayed on the mock-up:

 * Current objectives and progress for both teams (varies by map type)
 * Player's current team
 * Melee weapons
 * Currently selected weapon
 * Class-specific 'weapons' (Engineer's PDAs, Spy's sapper etc.)
 * Custom crosshair (may or may not be implemented)

All used fonts can be found from the [mockup_fonts.txt](./mockup_fonts.txt) file.
